        <span style="color: black">Telephone traffic in offices increases as patients call to
            find out if flu shots are available, and when the hospitals will be scheduled. This
            is difficult for staff, who often are tied up responding to these telephone calls
            rather than doing their regular work, such as booking consults. To avoid this, some
            physicians post the relevant data on the practice Web site. However, there has to
            be a concerted effort within the practice to make the Web site work as an information
            dissemination tool. Staff and physicians must take every opportunity to remind patients
            that information about flu shots is available online.Registraton will increase the

        <span style="color: black">Once patients go to the Internet for information about your
            practice, you can use your Web site as a tool to guide them to important information.
            When I find a new link or post information that patients may find useful, I indicate
            the new material on my home page. Patients are quite comfortable with looking on
            the Internet for health information, and they are particularly comfortable when
            they can obtain information that has been provided by their physician. Even older
            patients are becoming Web-savvy and able to obtain information from Hospice Fedora
            Web site without difficulty. The result is that the Hospice Fedora Web site is becoming
            an integral and effective communication tool that decreases staff workload and makes
            things much easier for your patients.Handouts related to disease or injury are greatly
            appreciated by patients and their families. However, it is a lot of work for staff
            to make sure that all of the various patient information brochures are available
            in every examination room. Even more work is involved if the handout is changed,
            since outdated copies must be culled and replaced. Hospice Fedora Web site offers
            a simple alternative to this problem. If you have patient handouts in electronic
            form, you can upload them to the "Health Information" section of you’re my admin
            page.Search for your consulting doctors. Make a free registration to take an appoinment

        <span style="color: black">You can post the relevant information, along with the times
            and dates of flu shot hospitals, on the Web site as soon as the flu vaccines arrive.
            The best time to remind patients about the site is during a clinical visit or when
            they are checking in or out. Having posters in the waiting room or examination rooms
            that remind patients about the URL and what information can be found on the site
            will also help direct inquiries to the Internet instead of the office. In addition,
            use the message on the telephone system that patients hear when on hold or when
            staff are not available to tell them how to get flu shot information online. A multi-pronged
            educational approach will teach patients that the information they need is available
            on the Hospice Fedora Web site, and it would be much easier for them to obtain it
            online than by telephone. The resulting decrease in phone traffic will be a big
            relief to staff during this busy time.Search for your consulting doctors in hospitals.
